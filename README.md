# Image to Caption Generator


The Image to Caption Generator is a powerful deep learning model that can generate descriptive captions for a given input image. This repository contains the code and resources needed to train, fine-tune, and deploy the image captioning model. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the input image and feeds those features to a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate the caption. The model is trained on a large dataset of images paired with corresponding captions.

## Features


- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** We provide a user-friendly interface that allows you to upload an image and quickly get a descriptive caption generated by the model.

- **Customizable:** The model can be fine-tuned on specific datasets to adapt to domain-specific vocabulary and contexts.
