The Image to Caption Generator is a powerful deep learning model that can generate descriptive captions for a given input image. This repository contains the code and resources needed to train, fine-tune, and deploy the image captioning model. 

## Features

- **State-of-the-art Model:** The generator is built on a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture that can understand the content of images and generate coherent captions.

- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** We provide a user-friendly interface that allows you to upload an image and quickly get a descriptive caption generated by the model.

- **Customizable:** The model can be fine-tuned on specific datasets to adapt to domain-specific vocabulary and contexts.

## Installation

To set up the Image to Caption Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-caption-generator.git
   cd image-caption-generator
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained weights for the image captioning model:

   _Link to pre-trained weights or instructions on how to obtain them._

## Usage

1. Run the generator using the provided script:

   ```bash
   python generate_caption.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
   ```

   This will process the input image and generate a caption.

2. If you want to fine-tune the model on a specific dataset, refer to the `fine_tune.ipynb` notebook. Adjust the hyperparameters and training settings according to your needs.

3. For deployment, the `app` directory contains a web application that utilizes the trained model to generate captions from user-uploaded images. Follow the instructions in the `app/README.md` to set up and run the web application.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Image to Caption Generator:

```bash
python generate_caption.py --image_path images/sample_image.jpg
```

Output:
```
Generated Caption: "A group of friends enjoying a day at the beach."
```
